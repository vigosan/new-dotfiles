# Infrastructure Guidelines

## Docker Requirements

### Service Containerization
**MANDATORY**: All services (frontend, backend, database, etc.) MUST have their own Dockerfile.

- **Individual Dockerfiles** - Each service maintains its own optimized Dockerfile
- **Multi-stage builds** - Use multi-stage builds for production optimization
- **Security practices** - Non-root users, minimal base images, vulnerability scanning
- **Environment configuration** - All environment variables configurable via Docker

### Orchestration & Build Integration
- **docker-compose.yml** - Complete stack orchestration
- **Development environment** - Local development with hot reload
- **Makefile integration** - `make dev`, `make build`, `make deploy` use Docker
- **Testing in containers** - All tests run in containerized environment
- **CI/CD ready** - Docker images built and tagged for deployment

### Container Best Practices
- **Layered caching** - Optimize layer order for build speed
- **Health checks** - All services include health check endpoints
- **Graceful shutdown** - Proper signal handling for clean shutdowns
- **Resource limits** - CPU and memory limits defined
- **Security scanning** - Container images scanned for vulnerabilities
